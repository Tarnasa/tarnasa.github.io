<p>After giving up on Terath, I started on another 2-player game.
I had been playing Starcraft: Brood War a lot those days, especially the custom maps.
There was a particular map called "Income D" which was a 2-team tower defense game where you got income by sending units down your opponents path.
I basically recreated this custom starcraft map as a standalone game, it even has glitchy network support!
You can download the game, "Attack and Defense" and it's source files below.
(note the source file requires a copy of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker:_Studio">GameMaker 7</a>
to run)</p>

<p>A help file can be found in-game by pressing F1</p>

<p>In case you are not familiar with tower defense games,
the objective is usually to survive multiple waves of enemies which follow a path.
If the enemies manage to reach the endpoint then you lose a life, lose all your lives and you die.</p>

<p>You kill these enemies by placing stationary "towers" which can attack the units.
These turrets cost money which <i>usually</i> is earned by killing enemies.
But in this version money is earned by <b>sending</b> units down your opponent's path.</p>

<p>This game has a rudimentary AI, support for 2-player couch-coop, and basic networking support.</p>

<p><small>ps. there are cheat codes hidden in the help file</small></p>
