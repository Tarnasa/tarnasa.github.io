<title>Reviving my first laptop</title>

    While going through my old things this Christmas I found my first laptop, an HP Pavilion dv6.
    After rummaging through a few boxes for the appropriate charger, I plugged it in and turned it on, only to be greeted by a blinking caps lock key,
    Apparently this meant that there was something wrong with the CPU.
    I decided to have some fun with it, and took it apart to see what could be done.
    When I finally got to the CPU I was glad to see that it was socketed, and that replacements were only around ~$10.
    If all goes well my family may have another laptop in the house!
