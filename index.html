                <p>Switching tasks from editing code to browsing the web to look for documentation on
                that new API I just started using (or have been using for a year) usually
                required me to move my hands off of the sacred home row to the mouse just so I
                could click a link.  Wasting time and focus.</p>
                
                <p>I need my internet browser to be completely mouse-free.
                Thankfully I am not the only one with this aspiration.
                A Firefox plugin called <a href="http://www.vimperator.org">Vimperator</a>
                adds Vim-like keybindings to almost every common browser action.</p>
                
                <p>The main feature of Vimperator is the way in which you navigate links.
                First you press 'f' and every clickable link on the page is highlighted yellow.
                Next you start to type the text inside a link and links which do not contain
                that text are un-highlighted.  If only one highlighted link remains, then it is
                'clicked' and you follow that link.
                Next to every highlighted link is a unique number.
                This number can be typed out as well, and used in cases where there are
                multiple links with matching text, or links with no text at all
                (clickable images for example).</p>
                
                <p>Some other features which I use quite often are:
                <ul>
                    <li>y - Copy the current url</li>
                    <li>; y - Copy a link</li>
                    <li>gf - Toggle between page and page source</li>
                    <li>/ - Highlight all occurrences of a word</li>
                    <li>o google cats - Use Google (instead of my default DuckDuckGo) to search for cats</li>
                    <li>O - Edit the current url and then open it (Supports C-w to backspace over words)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>If you don't like using the mouse,
                or want to impress your hacker friends,
                I highly recommend trying out vimperator.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="/images/f1x_th1s.png" width=612px/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                
                <p>Though it was 7 years ago that it was given life, it is only today it will be given an ending!</p>
                
                <p>My introduction to the webcomic was probably different from most.
                It all started when <a href="//c418.org">c418</a> stopped having direct playable links to his
                albums on his website, forcing me to go to <a href="//bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a>
                to listen to his albums.  At that time, the Homestuck albums were constantly
                at the top of the charts, and eventually I started listening to and enjoying the
                spunky Homestuck themes.</p>
                
                <p>Eventually I figured it was time to find out what Homestuck
                actually was (for all I knew it was just some indie band).
                Reading the first few pages, I immediately fell in love with the webcomic's
                vocabulary, John's shitty programming, and the many characters' shenanigans,
                which were at the same time incredibly silly and incredibly complex,
                with tons of self-referential jokes and plot elements.
                It was a story that felt like it had no obvious goal, or if it did, it didn't
                care how long it would take to get there, so instead it just looped in on
                itself, creating fantastical scenarios and observing the consequences of them
                (For example, John prototyping his kernelsprite with the harlequin doll).</p>
                
                <p>Within a few months I had completely caught up, and had just watched the amazing 
                <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/cascade.php?s=6&p=6009">[S] Cascade</a>.
                Along the way I had learned Morse code, how to read most of the trolls typing quirks,
                and a whole lot of unconventional English words.</p>
                
                <p>But then the came the gigapauses, and, like many other people, I stopped thinking about
                Homestuck things.  So when Homestuck came back around to wrap up the gig,
                I decided I had to do SOMETHING to commemorate the event.  There were dozens of us
                Homestucks at my college, DOZENS.</p>
                
                <p>I decided to print some of the most popular
                <a href="//reddit.com/r/homestuck">r/homestuck</a> memes and put them up around
                campus in what I deemed appropriate places.  I can't say it was the most
                professional thing I've done, but I did
                end up meeting a few other people who had read the comic as well.
                I also ended up creating a python script to grab these images for me using
                the subreddit's stylesheet and spritesheet.
                I doubt these silly faces will stay up long, but I hope others will get
                a chuckle finding them.</p>

                <q><b>Tarnasa</b>: Hmm, Where did you download it from?</q><br/>
                ...<br/>
                <q><b>Tarnasa</b>: Yeah that doesn't look legitimate at all :(</q><br/>
                <q><b>?</b>: I think someone is hacking the computer.</q><br/>
                <br/>
                
                <p>And thus began a week-long endeavor to return the computer to a usable state.
                Normally this would be an easy task, however I was currently hours away from
                the computer that needed repair, so everything would have to be done remotely.
                Ugh tech support.</p>
                
                <p>Not wanting to lose any data to possible ransom-ware, first I made
                sure that the computer was shut off.  Then I had them burn a live image of Debian
                to a USB so that they could boot into it and transfer files off the computer
                without giving the viruses a chance to interfere.</p>
                
                <p>Unfortunately, even after multiple attempts we were unable to boot the
                computer off of the USB, no matter what combination of boot options and f-keys.
                Thankfully there are other ways of booting off of
                external media, so I had them burn the live Debian image to a DVD.  Thankfully this
                worked like a charm, however instructing them to do everything was simply too
                slow and error-prone, so I had them configure the ssh server to allow
                connections through the Minecraft port which I had opened in the firewall
                many years prior.</p>
                
                <p>So now I was able to ssh in, but something was wrong, the OS seemed to run out of
                disk-space almost immediately after booting, was this some side-effect of
                running a live OS off of a DVD?  No, but a few <code>du -sh *</code> around
                the filesystem lead me to the <code>/etc/log</code> directory which contained multiple log files
                with sizes of around 1G each!  Apparently the wireless daemon kept erroring out
                because the desktop computer didn't have a wireless card (but did have a wired connection).
                So after defeating that daemon and its logs, the system was usable again.</p>
                
                <p>Now was time to actually start copying files off of the old windows partition
                and onto an external hard drive I had them connect to the computer.  But before that
                I wanted to know what kind of viruses I was dealing with.  Translating some
                of the chinese-character filenames yielded fairly benign chinese-software such
                as Tencent computer manager and MTView.
                I also found the original trojan <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5affe3f881d19e60a25a3a8f35127c764e22e9ce0f5716a0cb275d8a09032394/analysis/1453681636/">file</a>
                pretending to be a free-version of a game.</p>
                
                <p>After copying over what I thought was safe, I had them burn a windows ISO
                to another DVD and reinstall over the old OS.  And the day was saved.</p>

            <div>
                While going through my old things this Christmas I found my first laptop, an HP Pavilion dv6.
                After rummaging through a few boxes for the appropriate charger, I plugged it in and turned it on, only to be greeted by a blinking caps lock key,
                Apparently this meant that there was something wrong with the CPU.
                I decided to have some fun with it, and took it apart to see what could be done.
                When I finally got to the CPU I was glad to see that it was socketed, and that replacements were only around ~$10.
                If all goes well my family may have another laptop in the house!
