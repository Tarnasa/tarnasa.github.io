                <p>After giving up on Terath, I started on another 2-player game.
                I had been playing Starcraft: Brood War a lot those days, especially the custom maps.
                There was a particular map called "Income D" which was a 2-team tower defense game where you got income by sending units down your opponents path.
                I basically recreated this custom starcraft map as a standalone game, it even has glitchy network support!
                You can download the game, "Attack and Defense" and it's source files below.
                (note the source file requires a copy of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker:_Studio">GameMaker 7</a>
                to run)</p>
                
                <p> <a href="/games/atk_and_def.7z">Download Link</a> </p>
                
                <p>A help file can be found in-game by pressing F1</p>
                
                <p>In case you are not familiar with tower defense games,
                the objective is usually to survive multiple waves of enemies which follow a path.
                If the enemies manage to reach the endpoint then you lose a life, lose all your lives and you die.</p>
                
                <p>You kill these enemies by placing stationary "towers" which can attack the units.
                These turrets cost money which <i>usually</i> is earned by killing enemies.
                But in this version money is earned by <b>sending</b> units down your opponent's path.</p>
                
                <p>This game has a rudimentary AI, support for 2-player couch-coop, and basic networking support.</p>
                
                <p><small>ps. there are cheat codes hidden in the help file</small></p>
