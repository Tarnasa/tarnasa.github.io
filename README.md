Write posts in grist/posts/
Theses posts should follow the following template:

<title>PUT_TITLE_HERE</title>
<date>PUT_DATE_HERE</date>
<body>
PUT_POST_BODY_HERE
</body>

After posts have been written, run alchemize.py from the root directory.
This will generate index.html, and create pages/DATE-TITLE.html files for each post.

The files in grist/templates are used to construct webpages.
(Currently only supports header and footer)
