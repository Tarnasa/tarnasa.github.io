                <p>Ever since using vim and vimperator, I've gotten used to mapping the
                Caps Lock key to act like another Left Control key.
                In windows I did this by setting the registry key
                <pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout\Scancode Map</pre>
                To the following binary value
                <pre>
                00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
                02 00 00 00 58 00 3A 00
                00 00 00 00
                </pre>.
                In Arch Linux I would use this .Xmodmap file:
                <pre>
                clear lock
                clear control
                keycode 66 = Control_L
                add control = Control_L Control_R
                </pre>.</p>
                
                <p>When I switched between computers often, these configuration changes became
                impossible, the windows change even required me to have administrator access.
                This is when I had the idea for a hardware-based key remapper.
                A device that sits between a USB keyboard and a computer, intercepts the
                keystrokes, and remaps them before they even hit the computer,
                no more configuring every computer I work at, and I could take this device
                with me everywhere I go.</p>
                
                <p>Well I finally got around to making it.
                Here are the components I used:
                <ul>
                    <li>Teensy 3.6</li>
                    <li>DuinoFun mini USB Host Shield</li>
                </ul></p>
                
                <p>The USB Host Shield allows the device to act as a "USB Host" just like
                your computer acts as a USB host to your mouse, keyboard, and whatever other
                "USB Device"s you may have.
                When I started the project, I intended to use a circuits@home version of
                the mini USB Host Shield, but I couldn't find a place to buy them ANYWHERE
                and the original shop's site was broken.
                So I had to settle with the DuinoFun version,
                which I could find zero documentation for, except for a
                <a href="http://ti994a.cwfk.net/TiUsbKeys.html">single project</a>
                where someone else had used it.
                So a week later and my chip came in from China.<br/></p>

                </a>
                
                <p>I had bought a Teensy 2.0 to go along with it (Because of
                <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_USBHostShield.html">PJRC's USBHS article</a>
                ) Unfortunately I had completely missed the part about needing a MCP1825S-3302E/DB
                to convert the Teensy 2.0 to run at 3.3V.  And without quick access to one
                of those, I decided to test the USBHS with an Arduino Uno I had won a few years
                back.<br/><br/>
                <a href="/images/uno.jpg">
                    <img src="/images/uno.jpg" alt="Arduino UNO" height=200px/><br/>
                </a>
                So I wired it up to the Uno according to
                <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoUSBHostShield"/>Arduino's USBHS page</a>
                and the USBHS pins shown on
                <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_USBHostShield.html">PJRC's USBHS article</a>
                and hoped that everything would just work.
                Fired up Arduino IDE and installed the USBHostShield 2.0 library
                and tried to run the included board_qc sketch meant to test
                the USBHS.
                Unfortunately this failed many times, it wasn't until hours later
                of replugging everything in and browsing forums that it just magically
                worked out of the blue.  Nevertheless it is was not reproducable,
                and I figured the Uno was just too old to work well with the newer hardware.</p>
                
                <p>I needed a board capable of acting as a USB Device
                (Specifically a keyboard) to the computer.
                I whent back to the store and bought a Teensy 3.6 which already runs
                at 3.3V (as opposed to the Teensy 2.0 and Uno).
                Connecting the Teensy 3.6 to the USBHS according to
                <a href="http://www.circuitsathome.com/mcu/teensy-3-0-now-supported-by-the-usb-host-library/">this article</a>
                worked perfectly, except that
                the USHS could only handle low-power USB devices, like old
                flash drives, but not a backlit USB keyboard.
                I knew that in the current configuration, the USBS could only provide
                3.3V to the USB device, however, most USB devices expect 5V,
                therefore I needed to route the 5V from the computer going into the Teensy
                to the USBHS and then to the USB Device.
                To do this, I connected the VIN of the Teensy 3.6 to the VBUS pad on
                the USBHS and cut the jumper running from the VBUS pad to the USBHS
                as shown below.</p>
                <a href="/images/usbhs_vbus_pad.jpg">
                    <img src="/images/usbhs_vbus_pad.jpg" alt="USBHS VBUS Pad" height=200px/>
                </a>
                
                <p>Now, the board worked perfectly, all that was left was to code
                up the sketch to grab the keystrokes coming from the keyboard,
                possibly modify them, and send them onto the computer.</p>
                
                <p>The USB Host Shield library v2.0 did not work out of the box with the Teensy 3.6,
                I had to modify the config files to get them to recognize it's id (and treat it therefore like a Teensy 3.0).</p>
                TODO TODO TODO TODO
                
                <p>USB Keyboard send their state to the USB Host as a wrapped packet containing
                2 to 8 bytes.
                <pre>
                struct MODIFIERKEYS {
                        uint8_t bmLeftCtrl : 1;
                        uint8_t bmLeftShift : 1;
                        uint8_t bmLeftAlt : 1;
                        uint8_t bmLeftGUI : 1;
                        uint8_t bmRightCtrl : 1;
                        uint8_t bmRightShift : 1;
                        uint8_t bmRightAlt : 1;
                        uint8_t bmRightGUI : 1;
                };
                </pre>
                The next byte is a reserved field, usually zero.
                The following 0 to 6 bytes (integers in 0-255) indicate which keys are
                being held down.
                Therefore all I have to do is intercept calls with a 0x14 key (Caps Lock),
                set bit 0 of the first byte, and remove the 0x14 key from being sent to the host.
                and then do similar when the key is released.</p>
                
                <p>I can think of many other interesting uses for this USB keyboard passthrough
                device.  For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Switch keyboard layouts (DVORAK to QWERTY) by pressing some key combination.</li>
                    <li>Keyboard macros which are undetectable from software.
                        (Cheat detection systems could not detect it by scanning the system)</li>
                    <li>Changing your typing rhythm to avoid biometric detection
                        (see <a href="https://github.com/leoneckert/deceit-board">https://github.com/leoneckert/deceit-board</a>)</li>
                    <li>Keylogger (Add a micro SD to the Teensy 3.6</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>To make your own, the two boards will cost you $30 for the Teensy 3.6 and
                around $10 for the USBHS.  However, it looks as though this could be done with
                a Teensy LC board (only $10) instead of the 3.6.
                Granted, the entire project may cost you alot more in tools
                (Soldering iron) and wires if you don't already have them.</p>

                <p><a href="/pages/2015-12-26-Reviving_my_first_laptop.html">Part 1 here</a></p>
                
                <p>I had first started to try to repair the laptop by doing simple things like
                removing the CMOS battery, and reseating the RAM.  But after those things hadn't worked,
                this is when I replaced the CPU.</p>
                
                <p>Unfortunately the replacement CPU didn't seem to change a thing, same error blink pattern on startup.
                So I researched other common ways to temporarily fix old laptops,
                hoping that learning something today would save me some trouble in the future
                when my new favorite laptop bites the dust.</p>
                
                <p>One new method I tried was reheating the motherboard in order to reflow the
                solder in places where there might be a small crack.  Many articles state
                that the easiest way to do this is to literally bake it in the oven.
                However I did not want to leave any chemical residue in my oven, so instead
                I used a heat-gun to heat up the motherboard.
                Taking some advice on common problems with HP laptops, I concentrated on the GPU.</p>
                
                <p>Reflowing didn't fix the problem either, so next I tried removing as many components
                as possible and booting from a minimal setup (shown in pic related).</p>
                
                <p>The last thing I tried (more crazy online advice) was to let the CPU
                overheat itself (I did this by disconnecting the heatsink and letting it run till
                it shut itself down).</p>
                
                <p>Even after all this it still wouldn't boot, so until I think of something
                else to do with this poor machine, it will remain in stasis.</p>

                <p>What would a completely free and open-source real-time-strategy with
                more than 6 years of active development but no marketing look like?</p>
                
                <p><a href="http://zero-k.info/">Zero-K</a></p>
                
                <p>While this game has a dangerously small community for how much effort has been
                put into the game, this RTS has, by far, the most thoughtful gameplay and balance
                I've ever encountered.
                Unlike many other games where developers will try to force units to fill a role
                such as "This unit kills small units" by making it do more damage to small units,
                Zero-k uses the actual physics of the unit's weapon, and the unit's AI (which
                can be quite advanced in this game) to create these relationships between
                units.</p>
                
                <p>For example, all bullets can be dodged, and instead of forcing the player
                to control every unit to dodge every bullet, units will try to do this
                themselves.  Making small nimble units able to avoid the heavy hitting shells
                of slower units.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, long-range units will automatically kite enemies,
                so that you can take down all those slow-moving close-range enemies.</p>
                
                <p>One of the leading ideas among the developers has been to never make the user
                have to fight the interface.
                This has lead to many extremely helpful features, such as the ability to draw
                the formation of where units will move to.  Allowing you create a convex shape
                quickly.</p>
                
                <p>On top of all of this, the game allows you to terraform (change the elevation
                of the map) during the game, allowing you to create ramps between previously
                inaccessible areas, create a height advantage for your turrets, or even to
                bury opponents expensive units!</p>
                
                <p>All units and structures are available to the player at the beginning of
                the game, so a player could, theoretically, start the match by trying to build
                a meteor-controlling superweapon, however these actions are very costly because
                heavy emphases is placed on expansion to capture "mexes" which generate metal
                income.</p>
                
                <p>But mexes are just one way to gain metal, the other, is to suck up the
                corpses of dead units (friendly and enemy).  This forces players to choose where
                they do battle because a failed attack in enemy territory gives the enemy extra
                metal to attack you with!</p>
                
                <p>Lastly, a resurgence of interest in developing AI's for the game has been
                happening the last year.  The two leading AI's are written in C++ and Java.</p>
                
                <p>If you have the time I highly recommend everyone check out this free,
                open-source game, and maybe even contribute to it!</p>

                <p>I need my internet browser to be completely mouse-free.
                Thankfully I am not the only one with this aspiration.
                A Firefox plugin called <a href="http://www.vimperator.org">Vimperator</a>
                adds Vim-like keybindings to almost every common browser action.</p>
                
                <p>The main feature of Vimperator is the way in which you navigate links.
                First you press 'f' and every clickable link on the page is highlighted yellow.
                Next you start to type the text inside a link and links which do not contain
                that text are un-highlighted.  If only one highlighted link remains, then it is
                'clicked' and you follow that link.
                Next to every highlighted link is a unique number.
                This number can be typed out as well, and used in cases where there are
                multiple links with matching text, or links with no text at all
                (clickable images for example).</p>
                
                <p>Some other features which I use quite often are:
                <ul>
                    <li>y - Copy the current url</li>
                    <li>; y - Copy a link</li>
                    <li>gf - Toggle between page and page source</li>
                    <li>/ - Highlight all occurrences of a word</li>
                    <li>o google cats - Use Google (instead of my default DuckDuckGo) to search for cats</li>
                    <li>O - Edit the current url and then open it (Supports C-w to backspace over words)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>If you don't like using the mouse,
                or want to impress your hacker friends,
                I highly recommend trying out vimperator.</p>

                <p>Though it was 7 years ago that it was given life, it is only today it will be given an ending!</p>
                
                <p>My introduction to the webcomic was probably different from most.
                It all started when <a href="//c418.org">c418</a> stopped having direct playable links to his
                albums on his website, forcing me to go to <a href="//bandcamp.com">bandcamp</a>
                to listen to his albums.  At that time, the Homestuck albums were constantly
                at the top of the charts, and eventually I started listening to and enjoying the
                spunky Homestuck themes.</p>
                
                <p>Eventually I figured it was time to find out what Homestuck
                actually was (for all I knew it was just some indie band).
                Reading the first few pages, I immediately fell in love with the webcomic's
                vocabulary, John's shitty programming, and the many characters' shenanigans,
                which were at the same time incredibly silly and incredibly complex,
                with tons of self-referential jokes and plot elements.
                It was a story that felt like it had no obvious goal, or if it did, it didn't
                care how long it would take to get there, so instead it just looped in on
                itself, creating fantastical scenarios and observing the consequences of them
                (For example, John prototyping his kernelsprite with the harlequin doll).</p>
                
                <p>Within a few months I had completely caught up, and had just watched the amazing 
                <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/cascade.php?s=6&p=6009">[S] Cascade</a>.
                Along the way I had learned Morse code, how to read most of the trolls typing quirks,
                and a whole lot of unconventional English words.</p>
                
                <p>But then the came the gigapauses, and, like many other people, I stopped thinking about
                Homestuck things.  So when Homestuck came back around to wrap up the gig,
                I decided I had to do SOMETHING to commemorate the event.  There were dozens of us
                Homestucks at my college, DOZENS.</p>
                
                <p>I decided to print some of the most popular
                <a href="//reddit.com/r/homestuck">r/homestuck</a> memes and put them up around
                campus in what I deemed appropriate places.  I can't say it was the most
                professional thing I've done, but I did
                end up meeting a few other people who had read the comic as well.
                I also ended up creating a python script to grab these images for me using
                the subreddit's stylesheet and spritesheet.
                I doubt these silly faces will stay up long, but I hope others will get
                a chuckle finding them.</p>
