                <p>Around 2008 I was really on a game-making spree.
                One my first "complete" games to come out of this was a turn-based base-expansion game called Terath.</p>
                
                <p> <a href="/games/terath_pbt.exe">Download Link</a> </p>
                
                <p>A help file can be found in-game by pressing F1, though I'll give a quick summary here:</p>
                
                <p>The objective of the game is to destroy all of your opponents pieces.</p>
                
                <p>Each player starts the game with a small "base" consisting of a few pieces</p>
                
                <p>Players take turns spending points on more pieces.
                Pieces must be attached to other friendly pieces.
                Some kinds of pieces generate points.
                Points <i>usually</i> do not carry to the next round.</p>
                
                <p>There 7 main types of pieces:
                <ul>
                    <li> Circle - Acts as a hub for bars, can be upgraded into other pieces.
                    <li> Bar - Generates points each turn.
                    <li> Cross - Placed between four circles, generates many points, some versions can shoot.
                    <li> Cannon - Fires a projectile in a single direction.
                    <li> Healer - Heals nearby pieces.  Upgraded from the circle.
                    <li> Block - High hitpoints, cannot place other pieces on top of a block.
                    <li> Tech - Allows for the purchase of next-tier pieces
                </ul>
                And a whole collection of other specialty pieces, such as a lightning rod, shield generator, and missile silo.</p>
                
                <p>Most of the heavy-hitting weapons are only available at higher tech-levels.
                Each new tech level costs considerably more than the previous
                but have more health, generate more points, and look cooler.</p>
                
                <p>Pieces can be placed on top of other pieces, (but not on top of a block).
                This means that players can stomp all over their opponent's base if they so choose.</p>
                
                <p>I never got around to creating an AI, so you will have to find a friend to play against!</p>
